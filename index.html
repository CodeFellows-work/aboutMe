      <h2>You made it! Where am I?</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Sunny and I was born and raised in Washington state. Although I have made mutliple attempts to leave, life always brought me back.</p>

      <img id="washington" src="./img/Washington-state-map.jpeg"/> 
      <h3>My First Attempt To Leave Washington State</h3>
      <p>My very first attempt to leave the state, began when I was given my first opportunity to leave the state - that was... turning 18. My ticket was the U.S. Navy. The Navy has brought me all sorts of opportunity, but leaving Washington was not one of them. After bootcamp and "A" school (a technical school) I was given a list of options to choose orders for. As I was at the top of my class, I was given the opportunity to choose first. Among the choices were:</p>
         
      <ul>
           <li>Japan</li>
           <li>Italy</li>
           <li>California</li>
           <li>More California</li>
           <li>The boat (the most undesired)</li>
           <li>Oak Harbor, Washington</li>
         </ul>

      <p>I chose everything except for Oak Harbor, Washington. But life just said no. I eneded up being stationed in Oak Harbor, Washington. As I exited the service and remained in Washington, I realized the beauty of being home. I now love Washington.

      <h2>My Education</h2>
      
      <p>As I mentioned, I joined the U.S. Navy and part of the reason for that was because I did not want to attend college. Little did I know, the Navy will force you to study and I probably ended up studying more than I would have in college. I later understood the importance of an education and decided to further my education past highschool.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <p>Although I have a good history of working as a mechanic with different types of aircraft, this is not my passion. I love technology and telling computers what to do. Therefore my goal is to surround myself with technology through a career change into software developement. My goals going further is to become a valuable asset within the software developer community.</p>
