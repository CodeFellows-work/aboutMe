### Reflections and Comments
* This was a more challenging lab, however it was good practice to go over the loops and nested loops as well as working with arrays with loops. 
* I have noticed that all of these loops require some kind of true or false statement. Previously I just coded just to code, but with this lab I was able to understand the true meaning between true and false. 
* I did not think that I would of finished this assignment before bed. But as I kept trucking along I noticeably starting understanding more. That being said, it still took me about 3 hours to complete.
