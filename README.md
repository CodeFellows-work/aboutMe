## About Me

My name is Sunny Lee, and I am a software developer. I ultimately want to be surrounded with software developement as a career so that I can do what I enjoy. Being a mechanic for 6 years has take a real toll on my body, and I want to change that before I put myself in any more danger.

### Reflections and Comments
* Overall I think that this assignment was fun.  It was not too difficult and I firmly believe it is because I paid attention during class and from the books and resources that were provided. 
* I don't have many questions just yet but I did notice that we went into detail on some of the things that were covered. I think that was a very good way for me personally to expand my knowledge of code and in this case JavaScript. I have some experience with JavaScript before this class and I got to understand more in-depth of what JavaScript provides. I got to be more familiar with the "let" and the switch statements. 
* In total, it took about 3 hours to complete what was due for this assignment for me. I also spent a lot of time on CSS exploring its properties and trying to understand each property so I took longer than I expected. When first reading about this assignment however, I thought I did relatively well with time. I thought that I would not finish at all today - but thanks to the lessons I think I was able to keep going through the motions without much obstacles which resulted in speeding up the process for this assignment.
