## About Me

My name is Sunny Lee, and I am a software developer. I ultimately want to be surrounded with software developement as a career so that I can do what I enjoy. Being a mechanic for 6 years has take a real toll on my body, and I want to change that before I put myself in any more danger.

### Reflections and Comments
* Overall I think that this assignment was fun.  It was not too difficult and I firmly believe it is because I paid attention during class and from the books and resources that were provided. 
* I don't have many questions just yet but I did notice that we went into detail on some of the things that were covered. I think that was a very good way for me personally to expand my knowledge of code and in this case JavaScript. I have some experience with JavaScript before this class and I got to understand more in-depth of what JavaScript provides. I got to be more familiar with the "let" and the switch statements. 
* In total, it took about 3 hours to complete what was due for this assignment for me. I also spent a lot of time on CSS exploring its properties and trying to understand each property so I took longer than I expected. When first reading about this assignment however, I thought I did relatively well with time. I thought that I would not finish at all today - but thanks to the lessons I think I was able to keep going through the motions without much obstacles which resulted in speeding up the process for this assignment.

### Reflections and Comments
* This was a more challenging lab, however it was good practice to go over the loops and nested loops as well as working with arrays with loops. 
* I have noticed that all of these loops require some kind of true or false statement. Previously I just coded just to code, but with this lab I was able to understand the true meaning between true and false. 
* I did not think that I would of finished this assignment before bed. But as I kept trucking along I noticeably starting understanding more. That being said, it still took me about 3 hours to complete.

### Reflexions and Comments 
* Initially I felt intimidated by functions. I felt that this lab helped me become more familiar with functions and also get more comfortable. I understand that functions are not simply used for nesting more code into the function and can be used for more complex things, but starting off this way makes it easier to improve and learn more about functions, understanding how functions work.
